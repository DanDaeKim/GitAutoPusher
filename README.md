Code Efficiency Analyzer
Code Efficiency Analyzer is a Python tool that automatically scans GitHub repositories, analyzes code using the GPT API, filters efficiency improvement suggestions, and generates reports for each repository. The goal of this tool is to help developers identify potential areas for optimization and improve the overall performance of their code.

Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- A GitHub account with access to the repositories you want to analyze
- An API key for OpenAI GPT

Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the following command:
- pip install PyGithub openai

Configuration
Create a config.json file in the root directory with the following structure:
{
    "github_access_token": "your_github_access_token",
    "gpt_api_key": "your_gpt_api_key"
}
Replace your_github_access_token with your personal GitHub access token. To generate a new token, follow the instructions in the GitHub documentation.
Replace your_gpt_api_key with your OpenAI GPT API key. To obtain an API key, sign up for an account on the OpenAI website and follow the instructions to enable API access.

Usage
Update the username variable in main.py with the GitHub username or organization you want to analyze:
- username = "your-github-username"

Run the main.py script:
- python main.py
The script will scan the specified user or organization's repositories, process the code files, analyze them with the GPT API, filter efficiency suggestions, and generate reports in the reports folder.
Check the reports folder for the generated efficiency improvement reports. Each report will be named after the repository with the suffix _efficiency_report.txt.

Modules
The Code Efficiency Analyzer consists of several modules:
- auth.py: Handles authentication for both the GitHub and GPT APIs.
- repo_scanner.py: Fetches the list of repositories for a given user or organization and processes the files in each repository.
- file_processor.py: Identifies relevant code files in the repositories and extracts their content for further analysis.
- gpt_analyzer.py: Sends the extracted code to the GPT API and receives suggestions for improvements.
- efficiency_evaluator.py: Filters and prioritizes efficiency-related recommendations from the GPT API suggestions.
- report_generator.py: Generates a report with the efficiency improvement suggestions for each repository.
- main.py: Integrates all modules and runs the end-to-end process.

Contributing
Contributions to the Code Efficiency Analyzer are welcome. If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to improve the code or documentation, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request on GitHub.
